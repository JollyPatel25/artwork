						<font size="4px" color="#000" ><center><h2>Some Basics For Sketching</h2></center>
					<pre>
 A sketch is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work. A sketch may serve a number of purposes: it might 
 record something that the artist sees, it mightrecord or develop an idea for later use or it might beused as a quick way of graphically demonstrating
 an image, idea or principle.Sketchescan be made in any drawing medium. 

 The term is most often applied to graphic work executed in a dry medium such as silverpoint, graphite, pencil, charcoal or pastel. It may also
 apply to drawings executed in pen and ink, digital input such as a digitalpen, ballpoint pen, marker pen, water colour and oil paint. The latter
 two are generally referred to as water colour sketches "and" oil sketches". A sculptor might model three-dimensional sketches in clay, plasticine
 or wax.
 <center>______________________________________________________________<br>The standard range of sketching and drawing pencils go through 9B to 9H and F.

 <h2> WHAT DO THE LETTERS MEAN?</h2>

 The letter ‘H’ stands for Hard, the letter ‘B’ stands for Black, and the letter ‘F’ stands for Fine.

 ===><b>H pencils</b> have a hard lead and remain sharp for a long time. They don’t leave much graphite on the page resulting in a very light or pale 
 drawing. Because they are hard they tend to dig into the paper surface making them difficult to rub out, as even if the graphite is removed with an 
 eraser the groove they made remains behind leaving ugly indentations over your page. These are not usually the best pencils for drawing and sketching.

 ===><b>B pencils</b> are softer and tend to get blunt very quickly. This is because they are leaving behind a lot more graphite on the page, which
 results in a darker drawing or sketch. You don’t need to press very hard to leave a mark which means they don’t dig into the page leaving those ugly
 indentations made by H pencils. Rubbing out with an eraser is far easier as the graphite tends to sit on top of the paper surface and is generally
 easily removed. These are generally considered the best 
 pencils for drawing and sketching.

 ===><b>F pencils</b> have extremely hard lead and are only occasionally found in pencil sets. HB pencils sit midway and are a nice average pencil to use. 
 This is usually your common office or school pencil.


 <h2> SO WHAT ARE THE BEST PENCILS FOR DRAWING AND SKETCHING?</h2>
 ===><b>HB</b>   This Pencil is used for very light line drawings on smooth paper. It can work really well for preparatory drawings as it does not 
 leave too much graphite on the page that could dirty any paint / watercolour painted on top. It has limited tone/shading capability but it’s 
 especially good if you’re a beginner and feel a little unsure when starting your drawings and sketching.

 ===><b>2B</b>    This pencil can be used as general drawing and sketching pencil. It’s great for sketching out, planning and blocking in the main areas of 
 tone/shade.It creates lovely quality of line and can be smudged a little and erased with ease if you wish. It’s still hard enough to sharpen to
 a point and use for the fine detail in drawings and sketches and creating the sharp edges to contrast with the soft areas in your drawings and 
 sketches.

 ===><b>6B</b>   Great for adding in substantially darker tones/shading that will make your drawings and sketches come to life as a contrast to 
 the lighter shades and white paper. This pencil has an excellent shading capability and creates some lovely rich dark grey tones. 

 ===><b>9B</b>    The 9B pencils and they usually shrink in size very quickly. Remember that the softer the pencil’s lead the more graphite it 
 leaves on the paper and the more it needs sharpening. This pencil will give you the darkest of shades, some beautiful smudging and blending 
 qualities and rich and varied quality of line. Just take care of its softness as if over used will result in drawings that lack sharpness and
 definition.
